//Creates a hexdump of file
//ffd8 = JPEG header signature
//ffd9 = JPEG footer signature (file has to end with)

//Identify the offset of the hex after ffd9 
//in the middle set of gibberish

//00009210 = Hex offset 
//0x921 + a letter corresponding to the position of the signature
// 921c

//read image.jpeg with blockset set to 1 after you've skipped <converted signature> ammount of lines n output 2 binfile
//CONVERTEDSIGNATURE = have to convert the signature's hex to decimal for 'skip' option with $(((16#value))

//since the resulting bin file ended with '=='
//its possible to deduce its a base64 enconded data-set
//so use the decoder on your bin

$ base64 --decode -i result.bin
//Right section of xxd or hexdump of a file helps recognise the assignment operator that
//hints to the encoding

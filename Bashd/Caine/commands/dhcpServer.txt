You often want to be on an isolated network 
So controlling your own DHCP server is essential
Your server will be set up in order to assign ip addresses to isolated clients

######################### :: Essentials :: #######################

1 - IP address

2 - NetMask
  //defines the size of the network that your device is on, used to identify when youre reacing an outside network

3- Default Getway
//192.168.1.1
// If a the destination is outside the netmask it will redirect to the default gateway

4- DNS
//Translate IP to domain names
etc/resolve/config
etc/host


:::::::::DHCP Capabilities:::::::
Assigns:

WINS Servers
Proxy Servers
NTP Servers
Domain name
Hostname

Only runs under UDP ports
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

INSTALL & CONFIGURATION

$ sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server -y

$ cat etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
Set up network interface on request or on a config file (ipconfig =eth0)

lease time is in minutees
Uncomment '#authoriative:' since the dhcp server is the admin one for your network
Define a subnet for your interface

'subnet 10.20.30.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
interface enp0s31f6;
range 10.20.30.100 10.20.30.150;
option routers 10.20.30.1;                             // the gateway is the .1 machine
option domain-name-servers 10.20.30.4, 10.20.30.8;    //Have them running on .4 .8 
option domain-name "companyX.dfir";                    //Name for This network  
}'


START

$ sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server
//Starts servers

$ systemctl status sc-dhcp-server
$ ps -aux | grep dhcpd
$ sudo netstat -lu4
//Checks status

$ tail -30 /var/log/syslog
//if it has failed upon restart search for your any compiling errors

$ sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
//restart

$ ip -br a
// if your interface is missing an interface address (IP)

$ sudo ip addr add 10.20.30.10/24 enp0s31f6
// To assign an IP to your server
// recheck status
// and that this dhcp server is on the bootps service (port 67)



TEST THE SERVER

$ sudo dhclient enx9405bb10822b
// from Another machine on the same physic LAN you can request an ethernet IP or a wireless IP
// specify an interface otherwise both ethernet and wireless interfaces will allow a search on their network

HANDSHAKE
Client: -----> Discover--> : Server
Client:<----- Offer ---<-- : Server
Client: -----> Request --> : Server
Client: <----- ACK -----<- : Server

resulting in the server granting an lease to the client


$ ping 10.20.30.10 
//pinging the server that leased us a dhcp ip
// to verify the ip was assigned properly

$ ip -br a


MONITOR 

$ tail -30f var/log/syslog
// To keep up with your dhcp activities inspect your logs for client requests and assignments

$ more /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
// Inspect for any unauthorised leases

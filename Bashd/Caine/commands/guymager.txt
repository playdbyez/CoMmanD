Forensic Imaging tool
by BitCurator Environment

Note: Keep aware of particular areas of a drive, particularly the HPA and DCO areas
HPA = Host Protected Area
DCO = Device Configuration Overlay



1- Evidence Hard drive
2- Ensure the storage media is wiped, partitioned and formated
3- Mount storage media, ensure its writable (Write Blocker)

//Avg Speed
USB2   - 27MB/s
USB3.1 -  300MB/s

//Add special device
converts image file into and .e01 or .aff

//Rescan
f5

//Acquire Image
[Creates an image file]
Select output format (.e01, .aff, .ewf, .dd)
.dd  = splits the file into smaller chunks dictated by the 'Split size' value (RAW)
.ewf = metadata + hash is compressed and contained within an .e01 file (PREFERRED)
Info = Log for the imaging process
Duplicate image = Select this option in order to maintain an Archive copy and a working copy

Image directory ... where to place image file

Verify image will check for bad sectors on the copy and require that after completion,
the dev is to inspect the info file for errors and make sure that hash source matches has image



//Clone Device
[Creates a bootable image  and mounts it onto a selected partition]
Ensure the destination drive is not mounted
Use unblock program to ensure destination is writable
Useful for:
      DVRs in order to preserve the original and work with the clone within the dvr
      Upgrade from spindle disk to SSD or replacing a failling hard disk


//Info
[runs smartcontroller and hdparm for info gathering on the selected device ]

//Raw Image
Select Acquire Image of the device and uncheck 'split image files'
After completion ensure image's file size is equal to the evidence partition


//HOW TO
>Mount storage drive and enable write capability
Ideally empty and volumous in size (Status:none)

>Run guymager as root.
Its interface then displays block devices connected

>Right clicking any block volume will give the following options 
(Acquire Image, Cloning, Info)

Log levels are used to issue system warnings to the user via the console.
  
  Severity
  [7] - KERN_DEBUG   = Used for debbuging
  [6] - KERN_INFO    = Actions performed by the kernel
  [5] - KERN_NOTICE  = 
  [4] - KERN_WARNING = Less severe errors
  [3] - KERN_ERR     = Failed driver, Failed device recognition
  [2] - KERN_CRIT    = Critical errors (Hardware/Software)
  [1] - KERN_ALERT   = 
  [0] - KERN_EMERG   = System instability, Imminent crash



Log levels can be scheduled to interact with the terminal via:

console_loglevel          =  Console will only display messages of a higher severity then specified
default_message_loglevel  = Default level asigned to an unclassed message
minimum_console_loglevel  = The highest level the console will display messages about
default_console_loglevel  = Level assigned to the console_loglevel at boot


In order to make persistant changes on the system, the default_console_loglevel can be altered by accessing :
$ etc/default/grub

Next, it is necessary to relad grub into the changes via the config or the wrapper command:
$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
$ sudo update-grub

[] watchdog = automatic reboot of hung systems (intended for servers)
[] quiet    = silent boot (turns off most log level messages)
[] dmesg    = displays driver and kernel-related messages retrieved from the kernel ring buffer (hardware faults, startup processes)
